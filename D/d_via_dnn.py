    Task D - WORLD MAP

    Given a "large" image and a set of smaller patches (of constant dimensions)
    find x,y coordinates of each smaller patch in the large image.
    Patches can be exact copies or filtered in some way.

    I've reread the statement and realized that it was guaranteed for the worlmap to remain the same on the private test set.
    Possible solution:
        Use a DNN to 'memorize' the worldmap i.e. to memorize each worlmap's patch
    Outline:
        - train a DNN with
            inputs: the given public set patches - RGB images
            labels: the given public set X,Y coordinate solutions - two nonnegative integers

            - input images aren't all the same dimensions
                - try upscaling to largest / downscaling to smallest / rescaling to some other fixed size
                    - no, this wouldn't work because patches match to patches of equal size on the worldmap
                - use the smallest size from the public set to train a network
                    - split the bigger patches into parts to augment the training set
                    - when applied to matching on the bigger patches,
                        - split the patch into smaller pieces
                        - use the NN to compute the smaller pieces positions
                        - and then fuse the positions into the position of the large patch
                        
            - ReLU should be fine activation for all layers, including the outputs, since they are nonnegative numbers

            - start with 1 or 2 layers, upscale and optimize along the way

            - there seems to be enough examples for simple 60/20/20 train-CV-test split, if not, use k-fold CV
